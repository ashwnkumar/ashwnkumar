<h1 align="left">👋🏽 Hey, I’m Ashwin</h1>

<p align="left">
I’m Ashwin Kumar — a MERN stack developer from Pune, India. I love creating web apps that are not just functional, but genuinely enjoyable to use. My sweet spot is frontend development, where I turn ideas and designs into seamless, interactive experiences. But I’m just as comfortable on the backend — building servers, APIs, and databases to make everything work smoothly behind the scenes.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me lost in music, binge-watching good movies, gaming, or capturing the world through my camera. Anything creative instantly grabs my attention.
