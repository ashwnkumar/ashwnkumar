<h1 align="left">👋🏽 Hey, I’m Ashwin</h1>

<p align="left">
I’m Ashwin Kumar - a MERN stack developer from Pune, India. I love crafting web apps that feel smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable to use. My sweet spot is <strong>frontend development</strong>, where I turn ideas, wireframes, and concepts into real, interactive experiences.  
But I’m equally comfortable working behind the scenes — building <strong>servers, APIs, and databases</strong> that make everything run seamlessly.  
Outside of tech, I'm usually exploring music, gaming, binge-watching good movies, or capturing moments through my camera. Anything creative instantly sparks my interest.
